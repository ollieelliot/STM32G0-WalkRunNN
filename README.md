# Motion detection on an STM32G0 microcontroller

# Hardware: 
  - The Schematic and PCB is designed in KiCad

# Software:
- Uses a neural network trained in Python and [emlearn](https://github.com/emlearn/emlearn) to save the weights, biases and activation functions to a header file in order to run inference in C (C99).
